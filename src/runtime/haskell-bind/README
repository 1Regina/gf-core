# PGF2

This is a Haskell binding to the PGF runtime in C.

The files are:

- PGF2.hsc: a user API similar to Python and Java APIs
- PGF2/FFI.hs: an internal module with FFI definitions for the relevant C functions

## How to compile

```
cabal install
```

**Note:** you must have the PGF C runtime already installed and available.
See <https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core/blob/master/src/runtime/c/INSTALL>

## How to use

Import PGF to the Haskell program that you're writing. 
The Cabal infrastructure will make sure to tell the compiler
where to find the relevant modules.

## Example

```haskell
module Main where

import PGF2
import qualified Data.Map as Map

main = do
  pgf <- readPGF "Foo.pgf"
  let Just english = Map.lookup "FooEng" (languages pgf)
```
