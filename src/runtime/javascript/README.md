**What about the pure JS runtime?**

As of June 2019, the JavaScript version of the GF runtime
has been replaced by a TypeScript version at: <https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-typescript>

This folder previously contained an example web application using the old JavaScript runtime,
which you can access [here](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core/tree/12079550f847a9f98eb0e1eca2fd0ea3d986a94a/src/runtime/javascript).
